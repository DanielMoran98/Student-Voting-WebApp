                <p>As an admin you will now be able to access all pages on poll-y without restriction. You also have the ability to remove/edit posts, remove comments and remove/edit user details</p>
                <p>Tasks: Ensure all votes/comments/images follow guidelines, and remove posts that do not follow them. Users with repeated offences may have their accounts revoked.
                 Admins are also in charge of closing votes on the date the Student Union chooses as the deadline. This is done in the edit section of a votes page by changing the state from '1' to '0'. The vote will be locked and the results will then be available to the public.</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>To edit/delete votes or comments go to the vote you would like to update and click the buttons on the panel on the right.
                    To update user records go to <a href="{{ url('user_index') }}">the user index</a>.</p>
